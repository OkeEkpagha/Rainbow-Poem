In the sea of information
This shiny ranbow pours out light of enlightenment
Waving arms, smily face, heavy brain
Pouring forth words with such enthusiasm
That I finally think wow! Why was I even scared in the first place?

Gratitude always for the rains to cool our lives
More gratitude for the rainbow to light up our skies
Fill us with some illumination.

The journey is long and hard
But good teachers make it feel easier
Gratitude always for the algo that led to this poem
About rainbows, git journey with its colors and forks.

Thank you.
